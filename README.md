# Wonkey Discord Rules & Community Charter 
*Date: 2025-07-01*  

---

## Purpose

Welcome to the Wonkey Discord!  
This server is dedicated to the evolution and advancement of the Sibly language family, with a focus on Monkey2/Wonkey and its upcoming successor. Our goal is to foster a high-quality, productive, and focused environment for language development, project sharing, and technical discussion.

This project is open-source, funded directly by its maintainer, and free for all. Please note: open-source languages take years to achieve real recognition. This community is here to accelerate that process—by discussing the language, platforms, and the amazing projects built with them.

## Functionality & Conduct Rules

**1. Invitation & Access**  
- Access is by invitation only (for now). Public opening is planned soon.  
- All new members must sign the guestbook before posting elsewhere.

**2. Focused Discussion**  
- The primary topic is Wonkey (and its evolution).  
- You may reference other languages or technologies, but never to promote them as superior or as alternatives.  
- Discussion of backends, platforms, and technical integrations is encouraged - within the context of advancing our project.

**3. Media Sharing**  
- Only post videos/tutorials directly relevant to Wonkey, its backends, supported platforms, or projects made with Wonkey.  
- Off-topic YouTube content (not about the language, its backends, or real projects) will be deleted.

**4. Technical Critique**  
- Criticism of technical decisions is welcome iff you propose a concrete alternative or improvement, better: implementation.  
- Unproductive negativity or vague complaints are not allowed.

**5. Platform Advertising**  
- No advertising for Apple, Google, or Microsoft.  
- We can compile to some backends without officially promote it (e.g., MS .NET, but due to .NET’s decompilation issues, promoting it as a primary solution is not allowed).

**6. Strong Typing & Performance**  
- Strongly typed, compiled languages are the backbone of this project’s performance philosophy.  
- Promotion of VM-based, pseudo/scripted languages as “better” than Wonkey is not permitted.

**7. Respect & Non-violence**  
- Standard rules of respect, non-violence, and constructive argumentation apply.  
- The goal is technical excellence and positive collaboration - leave the drama at the door.

## Notes on Implementation Choices

- The rules ensure high signal-to-noise and keep the focus on real progress.
- Open discussion of backends/platforms is allowed, as long as Wonkey remains the reference.
- The ban on VM language promotion isn’t about exclusion, but maintaining clarity on project goals: high-performance, strongly-typed code.
- Critique is invited, but only if it elevates the discourse: propose, don’t just oppose.
- The Gold-Book serves as a soft onboarding filter, ensuring newcomers understand and accept these guidelines before participating.

## Technical Advantages of Our Approach

- **Performance-First:** Wonkey’s design delivers best-in-class speed and efficiency, outperforming modern alternatives in real benchmarks.
- **Focused Community:** By keeping discussions on-topic, we accelerate both language and ecosystem growth.
- **Open & Free:** Community-driven, but with strong moderation to prevent dilution of purpose and ensure lasting project value.
- **Longevity:** We recognize that language adoption is a marathon, not a sprint. Our rules and focus are here to make those years count.
